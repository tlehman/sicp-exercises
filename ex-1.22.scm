; Exercise 1.22: Most Lisp implementations include a primitive called runtime that returns an integer that specifies the amount of time the system has been running. The following timed-prime-test procedure, when called with an integer n, prints n and checks to see if n is prime. If n is prime, the procedure prints three asterisks followed by the amount of time used in performing the test.

(load "helpers.scm")
(define (runtime) (tms:clock (times)))

(define (timed-prime-test n)
  (start-prime-test n (runtime)))

(define primes-found 0)

(define (start-prime-test n start-time)
  (if (prime? n)
      (begin
	(set! primes-found (+ primes-found 1))
	(newline)
	(display n)
	(report-prime (- (runtime) start-time)))))

(define (report-prime elapsed-time)
  (display " *** ")
  (display elapsed-time))

; Using this procedure, write a procedure search-for-primes that checks the primality of consecutive odd integers in a specified range. Use your procedure to find the three smallest primes 

;larger than 1000; 
;larger than 10,000; 
;larger than 100,000; 
;larger than 1,000,00;

(define (search-for-primes lower-bound upper-bound)
  (if (and (<= lower-bound upper-bound) (< primes-found 3))
      (begin (timed-prime-test lower-bound)
	     (search-for-primes (+ lower-bound 2) upper-bound))))

(search-for-primes 1001 9999)

; Note the time needed for each prime. Since the testing algorithm has order of growth Theta(sqrt(n)), you should expect that the testing for primes around 10,000 should take about sqrt(10) ~= 3.16227 as long as testing for primes around 1000.

; Do your timing data bear this out?

; How well do the data for 100,000 and 1,000,000 support the Theta(sqrt(n)) prediction?

; Is your result compatible with the notion that programs on your machine run in time proportional to the number of steps required for the computation?
