; Exercise 2.36: The procedure accumulate-n is similar to accumulate
; except that it takes as its third argument a sequence of sequences,
; which are all assumed to have the same number of elements.
;
; It applies the designated accumulation procedure to combine all the
; first elements of the sequences, all the second elements of the
; sequences, and so on, and returns a sequence of the results.
;
; For instance, if s is a sequence containing four sequences,
; ((1 2 3) (4 5 6) (7 8 9) (10 11 12)), then the value of
; (accumulate-n + 0 s) should be the sequence (22 26 30)
; (As a matrix, it would be a sum over the columns)
;
; Fill in the missing expressions in the following definition of
; accumulate-n:

(load "helpers.scm")

(define (accumulate-n op init seqs)
  (if (null? (car seqs))
      nil
      (cons (accumulate op init (map car seqs))
	    (accumulate-n op init (map cdr seqs)))))

; => (22 26 30)
